## Common Features of a Level 2 Todo App

- **Task Management:** Users can create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- **Categorization:** Ability to assign labels or categories to tasks for better organization.
- **Prioritization:** Set priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to tasks.
- **Due Dates:** Assign due dates and possibly receive reminders or notifications.
- **Search and Filter:** Quickly search and filter tasks based on keywords, labels, or status.
- **Responsive Design:** Accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.

If your application includes these features, it aligns well with the expectations of a Level 2 Todo App. To gather specific feedback:

- **User Testing:** Share the link with friends or colleagues and ask for their impressions and any issues they encounter.
- **Analytics Tools:** Implement tools like Google Analytics to monitor user behavior and identify areas for improvement.
- **Feedback Forms:** Incorporate a feedback form within the app to collect user suggestions directly.

These steps can provide valuable insights into user experience and potential enhancements for your project.
